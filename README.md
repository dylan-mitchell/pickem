# Pickem

A WIP progress that I've been using to learn Firebase, MongoDB and React. This project is a basic web app that allows users to create groups and challenges that users in said group can compete in. These challenges are designed to be picking who you think will win a certain NBA game.

The frontend is built in React while the backend uses Go to interface with MongoDB. Firebase is used to manage user accounts.
